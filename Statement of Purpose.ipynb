    "Peter Norvig: Well, first of all, I object to that, because I think that’s a low target to aim at. [Audience laughs.] Right, ’cause certainly there’s lots of things already that computers are much, much better than people at. [. . . ] We want to be able to say, “What is it that humans can’t do that computers can do better?” Now, part of that may be that the computers want to have some basic competency at the human-level in order to interact with us better. But the goal shouldn’t be human-level performance. The goal should be super-human partnership. [http://www.kqed.org/a/radiospecials/R201111302000] \n"
