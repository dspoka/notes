    "- A large number of studies have shown that child-directed speech (CDS) exhibits distinct features at all levels of linguistic processing: it is slower in rate, wider in pitch range, and contains fewer dysfluencies; it is syntactically simpler and less ungrammatical, with shorter sentences and scarce complex structures such as subordinate clauses or sentential complements; and it makes use of a more limited vocabulary, which is typically constrained to the child’s interests and focus of attention\n",

    "    - Mean Word Length (WL): length of words measured in characters, averaged over a dialogue; a rough indicator of morphological complexity.\n",
    "    - Mean Number of Word Types (WT): the number of distinct word types in a dialogue divided by the number of utterances by the relevant speaker in that dialogue; a rough indicator of lexical complexity.\n",
